# This file holds configuration for taint propagation analysis of Kubernetes source via go-flow-levee.
# It defines sources which may contain credentials and sinks where these should not be logged.
# Sources may be identified by the FieldTags element, or by matching package, type, and field explicitly in the Sources element.
# Sanitizers permit sources to safely reach a sink.
# False positives may be suppressed in the Exclude block.
# Note that `*RE` keys have regexp values.

# These field tags were introduced by KEP-1753 to fields which may contain credentials
FieldTags:
  - Key: "datapolicy"
    Val: "security-key"
  - Key: "datapolicy"
    Val: "token"
  - Key: "datapolicy"
    Val: "password"

# This preliminary collection of source types should be removed once
# KEP-1753 adds tags to the relevant fields.
